# Name mangling to access private member
# Private members are not accessible directly outside the class but can be accessed using name mangling.
# Protected members are accessible within the class and its subclasses but should be treated as non-public.
# Public members are accessible from anywhere.  
# In Python, these are just conventions and do not enforce access restrictions like in some other languages.

class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__private_var = 42  # Private variable

    def get_private_var(self):
        return self.__private_var  # Public method to access private variable   
t = Test()
# print(t.__private_var)  # This will raise an AttributeError   
print(t.get_private_var())  # This will work and print 42
print(t._Test__private_var)  # Accessing the private variable using name mangling   
# Name mangling is a mechanism in Python that alters the name of private variables to prevent accidental access and modification from outside the class.
# It is done by prefixing the variable name with _ClassName.
